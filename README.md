# Resources-For-Young-Engineers

Recently an old friend got in touch. Her friend’s 9 yo son was interested in engineering and she hoped to encourage him. He was bright and eager. He’d already built a telescope, prototyped an engine, and was working through a 500 circuit electrical engineering kit.

Also, teaching himself Arabic and Spanish.

Like I said, bright and eager.

I asked around and learned of a few resources for young budding engineers, and wanted to share them.

(Many of these are free/low cost/scholarship based because the friend is a single mom with three kids, living on disability, and a cancer diagnosis with low survivorship rates. They don't have much. They also have an Ann Arbor, MI focus: that's where they live.)
